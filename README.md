## Introduction

This job salary dashboard was designed to assist job seekers in exploring salary data for their desired roles and ensuring they are receiving fair compensation.

The data comes from [Luke Barousse](https://www.lukebarousse.com/) course, which offers a solid foundation in data analysis using this powerful tool. It includes detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and key skills, all of which are featured in this dashboard.
